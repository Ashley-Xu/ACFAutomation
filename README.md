# ACFAutomation
In my ACF (Applied Corporate Finance) class, we learned how to use the structure of binomial options pricing to valuate a project with uncertain future cashflows. It takes on average 2 hours to do the valuation in excel so I thought I would give it a try to automate this process. There are many online resources on the math behind Binomial Option Pricing, but I don't see anything about Future Cashflow on Corporate projects' valuation yet.
