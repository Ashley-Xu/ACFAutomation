# ACFAutomation
In my ACF (Applied Corporate Finance) class taught by Prof Jiro Kondo, we learned how to use the structure of binomial options pricing to valuate a project with uncertain future cashflows. 

It takes me on average 1.5 hours to do the valuation in excel and by hand so I thought I would give it a try to automate this process. 

Please check out the math and theory behind this valuation model here: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Calculation-process-on-revised-binomial-lattice-model-with-parallel-option_fig4_281434195

Another source that I used is the presentation from the Professor at NYU Stern, Aswath Damodaran: http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/packet3a.pdf
